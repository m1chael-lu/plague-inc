plague NETS 1500 Final Project Summary

Inspired by the popular infection simulation game Plague Inc., we created a simplified version of the game in Java. The game leverages scraping to collect each US city and various demographic factors that we use.
We also use a graph to hold all of our CityNodes and their weighted connections. We use a BFS-like algorithm to simulate the infection over time. We included customization, to customize the name, infection type (virus, bacteria, etc.), and the starting city.
The core of our project is the math modeling that determines how and when an infection spreads as well as the evolution chain. In addition, we include a visualization that's similar to that of the real game to show how the infection spreads over time. This summary is a brief synopsis of our project, but you can read into the various features, modeling, andn implementations in the README file.
